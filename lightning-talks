Big Dada
Thomas Levine (http://thomaslevine.com/) and
Dave Riordan (https://twitter.com/Riordan)

Data have become sexy and mainstream [1,2,3], and
their use is fundamentally related to sharing and control.
This presents an opportunity for spreading free culture
ideals to a range of audiences. In this talk, we discuss
how this hip data thing is founded on free culture concepts
and how data can be remixed to produce original works.
We hope this will get you thinking.

I'll probably refer to my pages because it's easier than
thinking of other people's sources.

The .NYC Advisory Board
Tom Lowenhaupt (toml at communisphere dot com, connectingnyc.org)

A new city entity that's establishhed to guide the development of the .nyc TLD (Top Level Domain - like .com and .org but just for New Yorkers.)

I'm a member and will request proposals for such digital resources as:

voters.nyc
books.nyc
etc.



EME has landed, run for your life!
Andrew Davis ( @diffalot, http://userspace.io/ )

Though EME should not land in the w3c Spec, it's already implemented by large vendors, 
and content producers will undoubtedly be asking web developers to help them use it.  
One aspect of the EME that has not been discussed enough is its reliance upon Content 
Delivery Management software (CDM - a license verification and negotianion server).  

An interesting project that was killed when Oracle bought Sun was project DReaM [1], a 
license verification server designed to be compliant with RDFa and CC licenses.

I'm interested in opening the discussion to how we can provide such a system so that 
producers will be able to experiment with how their own media is licensed to see first 
hand the benefits of open vs. closed distribution systems

Open Access and Clinical Trials
Brandon Milholland
we trust that the medicines approved by the FDA, prescribed to us by our doctors, and responsible for billions of dollars of revenue have been subject to a 
rigorous process of testing before coming on the market. However, there is actually a troubling lack of transparency surrounding the process of clinical trials. 
I will argue that Free Culture and open access to data an provide SA solution to this problem and improve the state of medical research and quality of medical 
care.

Suggestions
* Tell your representative that you want stricter laws regarding the reporting of clinical trials.
* Read Bad Pharma by Ben Goldacre
